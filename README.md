# Explore US Bikeshare Data Project
## **OVERVIEW**

Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, we will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. we will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

**This projet have to be completed as part of [MiSK Foundation](https://hub.misk.org.sa) and [Udacity](udacity.com) Programming for Data Science with Python Nano-Degree (PDSND).**


## What Software Do I Need?
#### To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

1. Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).
2. A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).
3. A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

## Files

The original files are much larger and messier, and you don't need to download them, but they can be accessed here if you'd like to see them ([Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data), [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)). These files had more columns and they differed in format in many cases. Some [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) has been performed to condense these files to the above core six columns to make your analysis and the evaluation of your Python skills more straightforward. In the Data Wrangling course that comes later in the Data Analyst Nanodegree program, students learn how to wrangle the dirtiest, messiest datasets, so don't worry, you won't miss out on learning this important skill!


To answer the questions we have using Python, we did write a Python script. To help guide our work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare.py file, and we will do our scripting in there also. we will need the three city dataset files too:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

All four of these files are zipped up in the **Bikeshare** file in the resource.
